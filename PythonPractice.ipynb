    "PROS - If you like .NET you can do allot of things with the code in that one binary. Xamarin and Raspberry Pi are supported/work together by/with Microsoft Open Source now making it more convenient for .NET'ies.\n",
    "CONS - If you do not like .NET or the idea of installing MONO then not for you.\n",

    "PROS - Not sure but its an option\n",

    "\n",
    "Postfix\n",

    "If you can get postfix installed to recieve emails then you can tell it to dump the emails to a script- any script, bash, php, python or java if you like.\n",

Allot of control panels (if you own a domain with some baisc hosting - like justhost) will allow you to dump selected emails to a script (like postfix above).

Even in your emails put a line with encrypted text that your raspberry will decrypt so it knows its you and not some idiots attacking your system. To increase the security make it a mutating key that for example incorporates a timestamp(dd-mm-yy) so each day it will be encrypted differently but your Pi will know how to decrypt it.\n",
